	GUI
		ActionBar
			home-button --> back to the root-buttons
			list entries --> show logs
			...
		Button-Options
			create a QuantButton - longpress-->options (show graph;delete button; edit entry..)
			
	file handling
		save/load  buttons and logs  as json-file [ Done ]
		export as .csv; export logs for a single button as .csv
		import Taplog-button-db and Taplog-log [ not important ]
	create button
		nicer?
		more options?
	create entry
		Text-field!
		better slider?!
	logs
		
	show logs
		text-view/table-view like in taplog
			with the option to change an entry
				double-tap: open entry-view with these values
					therefore we need an init_with_values(log-entry, index)-function
					on_okay: save the changed log entry at the position it was log[index]=newLogEntry
			as nice as:
				show big
		all-in-one-graph
		single-button-graph
		graph-library or own?
			how should it look and feel like?
				days: top-down; hours: left-right; (good because the labels are in a better orientation) (bad because it differs from other long-time visualisations)
				short events as ellipses
				long events as (several) rectangles
				
			own
				paint with kivy-canvas
				touch-events
